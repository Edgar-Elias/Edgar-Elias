- 👋 Hi, I’m @Edgar-Elias
- 👀 I’m interested in computer programming and data analytics as well as sports and spending time with my family :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development skills such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am enrolled in  Harvard's CS50 course and find it rather challenging but rewarding once you figure out the problem sets and understand the content. Currently I am also close to completing Google's Data Analytics Program and find it incredibly interesting how you can solve problems and find useful insights with a little data cleansing and manipulation. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that is looking to find solutions to a problem. The reason I started getting interested in programing or data analytics was to use those skill to make a difference or achieve something that will solve problems and make life a little better or interesting.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
