- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Edgar-Elias

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data, big data and data analytics as well as sports (soccer, football and baseball) and spending time with my loved ones! :)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and polishing skills in python, r, MS Excel as well as working on how to better portrait data through story telling and visualizations through BI systems. I am enrolled in  Harvard's CS50 course and find it rather challenging but rewarding once you figure out the problem sets and understand the content. I started this course to better understand the inner workings of programming languages through computer science. </br>

- ðŸ“– Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that is looking to find solutions to a problem. The reason I started getting interested in programing and data analytics is to use those skill to make a difference or achieve something that will solve problems and make life a little better and interesting.
